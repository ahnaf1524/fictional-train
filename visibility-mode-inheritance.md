When **inheritance** is introduced, visibility modes play an important role in how members of a base class are inherited by a derived class. Let's go over **public** and **private** visibility with an example involving inheritance.

### **Public Members in Inheritance**
Public members of a base class remain accessible in the derived class and outside the derived class when accessed through an object of the derived class.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;

    void displayDetails() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    int numDoors;

    void showCarDetails() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed 
             << " km/h, Doors: " << numDoors << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;

    // Accessing public members through derived class object
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.speed = 200;
    myCar.numDoors = 4;

    // Using public functions
    myCar.displayDetails();
    myCar.showCarDetails();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Public Members in Base Class:** The `brand`, `speed`, and `displayDetails()` function are inherited as `public` in the `Car` class.
2. **Direct Access:** The derived class object `myCar` can directly access and modify these members because they are public in the base class.
3. **Output:**
    ```
    Brand: Toyota, Speed: 200 km/h
    Brand: Toyota, Speed: 200 km/h, Doors: 4
    ```

### **Private Members in Inheritance**
Private members of a base class are **not accessible** in the derived class. They can only be accessed indirectly through public or protected functions of the base class.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Vehicle {
private: // Private members
    string brand;

public:
    void setBrand(string b) {
        brand = b; // Private member set via public method
    }

    string getBrand() {
        return brand; // Private member accessed via public method
    }
};

// Derived class
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    int numDoors;

    void showCarDetails() {
        // Can't access brand directly because it's private in Vehicle
        cout << "Brand: " << getBrand() << ", Doors: " << numDoors << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;

    // Setting and getting private base class member via public methods
    myCar.setBrand("Honda");
    myCar.numDoors = 4;

    myCar.showCarDetails();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Private Members in Base Class:** The `brand` member in the `Vehicle` class is private, so the `Car` class cannot access it directly.
2. **Access Indirectly:** The `Car` class can only access `brand` through the public methods `setBrand()` and `getBrand()` of the base class.
3. **Output:**
    ```
    Brand: Honda, Doors: 4
    ```

### Visibility Modes and Inheritance Table

The visibility of inherited members depends on how the base class is inherited (e.g., `public`, `protected`, or `private`):

| **Base Class Member** | **Public Inheritance** | **Protected Inheritance** | **Private Inheritance** |
|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Public**            | Public in derived     | Protected in derived      | Private in derived       |
| **Protected**         | Protected in derived  | Protected in derived      | Private in derived       |
| **Private**           | Not accessible        | Not accessible            | Not accessible           |

### Why Use Private Members in Inheritance?
1. **Encapsulation:** Protects sensitive data in the base class while still allowing controlled access through public methods.
2. **Data Integrity:** Prevents derived classes or external objects from modifying data in unintended ways.

#### Example of Controlled Access:
```cpp
// In the Vehicle class:
void setSpeed(int s) {
    if (s < 0) {
        cout << "Speed cannot be negative!" << endl;
        return;
    }
    speed = s;
}
```
By keeping `speed` private and using `setSpeed()` for validation, you ensure only valid data is allowed.
