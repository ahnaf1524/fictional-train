Let's break down each point with simple explanations and real-life analogies:

### 1. **A `friend` class allows all member functions of one class to access the private and protected members of another class.**
   
In C++, classes typically protect their private and protected members, so other classes can't access them directly. However, a **friend class** is like an exception to this rule. If one class declares another class as a friend, the friend class can access the private and protected members of the first class.

**Real-life analogy:**  
Imagine you have a bank account. Normally, only you (the account holder) can access your private account balance. But, if you allow your **bank manager** (a friend class) to access your account, they can see your balance, make deposits, or withdrawals, even though it’s supposed to be private information.

### 2. **Friendship is not reciprocal: If Class A is a friend of Class B, Class B does not automatically become a friend of Class A.**
   
This means that just because one class allows another to access its private members, it doesn't mean the other class automatically gets the same privilege.

**Real-life analogy:**  
Imagine you allow your friend, John, to borrow your car. This doesn't mean that John automatically allows you to borrow his car. You must ask John if you want to borrow his car. So, **the friendship is not automatic** or mutual.

### 3. **Friendship is not inherited: A derived class does not inherit the friendship of its base class.**
   
If a base class declares a class as a friend, a derived class (which inherits from the base class) does not automatically inherit that friendship.

**Real-life analogy:**  
Suppose your parent lets your best friend into the house whenever they want. But, just because your sibling (the derived class) is your parent’s child, your sibling’s best friend doesn’t get the same privilege. They have to ask your parent directly. So, **friendship doesn’t pass down** through inheritance.

### 4. **Friendship is established by explicitly declaring a class as a friend within another class.**
   
A class becomes a friend of another class by being explicitly stated within the other class. This is usually done with the `friend` keyword in C++.

**Real-life analogy:**  
Imagine you run a club, and you decide that only a specific person (say your cousin) can enter the club room, even though normally it’s off-limits. You **personally** give that cousin permission to enter whenever they want. **You have to specifically invite them.**

### 5. **A friend class can access private and protected members using objects of the class granting friendship.**
   
Once friendship is granted, the friend class can access the private and protected members of the class that granted friendship. It does so by using objects of that class.

**Real-life analogy:**  
Let’s say you have a **private vault** in your house, but your friend (the friend class) has the keys to it. If you allow them to access the vault, they can use the keys to open it and take something out, even though the vault is meant to be private.

### Real-life Example of Friendship in Action:
Let’s say you are building a **Library** system.

- **Class A (Library)** has a private list of books that is not meant to be directly accessed by anyone else.
- **Class B (Librarian)** is a **friend class** of Class A. So, the librarian can directly check out books, even though the list is private.

```cpp
class Library {
private:
    std::vector<std::string> books;

public:
    Library() {
        books = {"C++ Basics", "Advanced C++", "Data Structures"};
    }

    // Declare Librarian as a friend
    friend class Librarian; 
};

class Librarian {
public:
    void showBooks(Library& library) {
        for (const auto& book : library.books) {
            std::cout << book << std::endl;
        }
    }
};
```

Here, `Librarian` is the **friend class** of `Library`, so the librarian can access the private `books` list and show the available books. But other classes can't access `books` directly unless they are also declared friends.
