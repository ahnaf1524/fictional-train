The `{}` (curly braces) in this context define a **scope** within the `main` function. This is important for understanding how the **destructor** works in C++. Let me explain in detail why the curly braces are used here:

### Purpose of `{}` in the Code:
1. **Scope Definition**:
   - The curly braces `{}` create a block of code with a **local scope**.
   - Any objects (like `g2` and `g3`) declared inside this block are **local to the block** and exist only within it.

2. **Object Lifetime Management**:
   - In C++, an object is automatically **destroyed** when it goes out of scope.
   - Here, `g2` and `g3` are created inside the block `{}`, and their **destructors** are called when the block ends.
   - This ensures that `g2` and `g3` are destroyed (or "leave the hall") before the program continues to execute the remaining code in the `main` function.

3. **Demonstrating Destructor Behavior**:
   - The block is used intentionally to demonstrate the behavior of destructors.
   - Without the block, `g2` and `g3` would remain in scope until the end of the `main` function. Using the block ensures that they are destroyed at a specific point in the program, allowing us to observe their destructors being called.

### Code Flow with `{}`:
- **Object Creation**:
  - `g1` is created outside the block and remains alive until the end of the `main` function.
  - `g2` and `g3` are created inside the block and exist only within it.

- **Object Destruction**:
  - When the block ends (the closing `}` is reached), `g2` and `g3` go out of scope, and their destructors are called.
  - After the block, only `g1` remains in scope.

### Without `{}`:
If the curly braces were removed, `g2` and `g3` would remain in scope for the entire `main` function. The destructors for `g2` and `g3` would not be called until the program ends, which would not demonstrate the intermediate cleanup (guests leaving) as intended.

### Example to Illustrate:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Example {
public:
    Example() { cout << "Constructor called.\n"; }
    ~Example() { cout << "Destructor called.\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Example e1; // Object e1 created

    { // Start of block
        Example e2, e3; // Objects e2 and e3 created
        // e2 and e3 exist only within this block
    } // e2 and e3 are destroyed here

    cout << "Back to the main function. e1 is still alive.\n";

    return 0;
} // e1 is destroyed here
```

### Output:
```
Constructor called.   // e1 created
Constructor called.   // e2 created
Constructor called.   // e3 created
Destructor called.    // e3 destroyed
Destructor called.    // e2 destroyed
Back to the main function. e1 is still alive.
Destructor called.    // e1 destroyed
```

In conclusion, the `{}` in your code is used to **control the lifetime** of `g2` and `g3` and demonstrate how destructors work when objects go out of scope.
