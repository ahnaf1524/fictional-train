### **Explanation of Friend Member Functions:**

In C++, **friend member functions** are functions that are not members of a class but are declared as **friends** of that class. These functions have special access to the private and protected members of the class, as though they were actual members. Friend member functions are typically defined outside the class but are granted permission to access private data due to the `friend` keyword.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Access to Private Members:**
   Friend functions, even though they are not part of the class, are allowed to access the private and protected members of the class.

2. **Friend Function Declaration:**
   The `friend` keyword is used inside the class to declare another class or a function as a friend. A friend function can access all members (private, protected, and public) of the class that grants friendship.

3. **One-Way Friendship:**
   Friendship is one-way. If Class A declares a function of Class B as a friend, Class B doesn’t automatically gain the right to access Class A’s private members.

4. **Defined Outside the Class:**
   Although a friend function is declared within the class, it is often defined outside the class body.

### **Real-Life Analogy for Friend Member Functions:**

Let’s consider the concept of a **safe deposit box** in a **bank**.

- The **Bank (class)** has private data: the **safe deposit box** (private member).
- The **Customer (member function)** has the key to access their box.
- However, the **Bank Manager (friend function)** is **not a customer** but has a special key to access any customer’s safe deposit box for legitimate reasons (like during emergencies or maintenance).

In this analogy:
- The **Bank (class)** has private data (safe deposit box).
- The **Customer (member function)** is like a normal function that has regular access to their own box.
- The **Bank Manager (friend function)** is like a special function that can access all safe deposit boxes (private members) of the bank but isn’t a customer themselves.

### **Real-Life Example:**

Imagine a **Library System** where a **LibraryMember** class stores private data such as the number of books a member has borrowed. A **LibraryAdmin** (friend member function) needs to access this private information to perform administrative tasks, like checking the number of borrowed books of each member.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class LibraryMember {
private:
    std::string name;
    int borrowedBooks;

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the library member
    LibraryMember(std::string n, int books) : name(n), borrowedBooks(books) {}

    // Function to display the member's information
    void displayInfo() const {
        std::cout << "Member: " << name << ", Borrowed Books: " << borrowedBooks << std::endl;
    }

    // Declare LibraryAdmin as a friend function
    friend void checkBooks(LibraryMember& member);
};

// Friend function to access private members of LibraryMember
void checkBooks(LibraryMember& member) {
    std::cout << member.name << " has borrowed " << member.borrowedBooks << " books." << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a LibraryMember object
    LibraryMember member1("Alice", 3);
    
    // Displaying the member's information
    member1.displayInfo();
    
    // LibraryAdmin checks the borrowed books of the member
    checkBooks(member1);  // Friend function access the private member borrowedBooks
    
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code:**

1. **LibraryMember Class:**
   - The `LibraryMember` class has private data: `name` (the member's name) and `borrowedBooks` (the number of books borrowed).
   - A public function `displayInfo()` is used to display the member’s information.
   - The class declares `checkBooks()` as a **friend function**, allowing it to access the private data (borrowedBooks) directly.

2. **checkBooks (Friend Function):**
   - The `checkBooks()` function is defined outside the `LibraryMember` class. Even though it’s not a member function, it can access the private member `borrowedBooks` because it’s declared as a friend.
   - The function simply prints how many books the member has borrowed.

3. **Main Program:**
   - A `LibraryMember` object `member1` is created with the name "Alice" and 3 borrowed books.
   - The `displayInfo()` function is called to show the member’s information.
   - The **friend function** `checkBooks()` is called, which accesses the private member `borrowedBooks` and displays it.

### **Output:**

```
Member: Alice, Borrowed Books: 3
Alice has borrowed 3 books.
```

### **Key Points from the Example:**

- The **LibraryMember** class encapsulates the data about its members, such as their names and borrowed books.
- The **checkBooks** function, although it is not a member of the class, can access the private member `borrowedBooks` because it is declared as a **friend function** of the `LibraryMember` class.
- The **friend function** has the ability to bypass the normal encapsulation and directly access private members.

This example shows how **friend member functions** can be used to allow special functions (like administrative tools) to access private data in a class when it’s needed for specific tasks.
