Yes, non-static methods **can** access static member variables in C++. The key distinction is that while **static methods** can only access static members (because they don't have access to any instance-specific data), **non-static methods** can access both static and non-static member variables of the class. 

This is because non-static methods belong to an **instance** of the class, so they can access the instance-specific (non-static) members. Additionally, they can still access static members because static members belong to the class, not any specific object.

### Example to Explain This:

Let’s use the same **TeaStall** example to demonstrate this. In this modified example, we’ll add a non-static method that accesses both the static and non-static member variables.

### Code Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class TeaStall
{
private:
    static int totalCupSold;  // Static member variable to track total cups sold across all tea sellers
    int cupsSoldBySeller;     // Non-static member variable to track cups sold by this specific seller

public:
    // Constructor to initialize cupsSoldBySeller
    TeaStall() {
        cupsSoldBySeller = 0;
    }

    // Non-static method to serve tea and update both instance and static member variables
    void serveTea(int cups)
    {
        cupsSoldBySeller += cups;    // Increase cups sold by this specific seller
        totalCupSold += cups;        // Increase total cups sold across all sellers
        cout << "Cups served by this seller: " << cups << endl;
    }

    // Static method to display the total cups sold across all sellers
    static void displayTotalCupsSold()
    {
        cout << "Total cups sold by all tea sellers: " << totalCupSold << endl;
    }

    // Non-static method to display cups sold by this specific seller
    void displayCupsSoldByThisSeller()
    {
        cout << "Cups sold by this seller: " << cupsSoldBySeller << endl;
    }

    // Non-static method can access static member variable directly
    void showBothCupsSold()
    {
        cout << "Cups sold by this seller: " << cupsSoldBySeller << endl;
        cout << "Total cups sold by all sellers: " << totalCupSold << endl;
    }
};

// Initialize the static data member outside the class
int TeaStall::totalCupSold = 0;

int main()
{
    TeaStall seller1, seller2;

    int cups;

    // Seller 1 serves tea
    cout << "Enter the number of cups sold by seller 1: ";
    cin >> cups;
    seller1.serveTea(cups);
    seller1.displayCupsSoldByThisSeller();

    // Seller 2 serves tea
    cout << "Enter the number of cups sold by seller 2: ";
    cin >> cups;
    seller2.serveTea(cups);
    seller2.displayCupsSoldByThisSeller();

    // Display total cups sold across all sellers
    TeaStall::displayTotalCupsSold();

    // Show both seller-specific and total cups sold
    seller1.showBothCupsSold();
    seller2.showBothCupsSold();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Static Member (`totalCupSold`)**:
   - `totalCupSold` is a static member, so it is shared across all instances of the `TeaStall` class. 
   - It keeps track of the total cups sold by all tea sellers.

2. **Non-Static Member (`cupsSoldBySeller`)**:
   - `cupsSoldBySeller` is an instance-specific member variable that tracks the number of cups sold by each specific seller (object).
   - Each object of `TeaStall` will have its own copy of `cupsSoldBySeller`.

3. **Non-Static Methods**:
   - `serveTea()`: A non-static method that updates both `cupsSoldBySeller` (specific to the object) and `totalCupSold` (shared across all objects).
   - `displayCupsSoldByThisSeller()`: Displays the cups sold by the current seller (object).
   - `showBothCupsSold()`: Accesses both the **static** and **non-static** member variables. It can do this because non-static methods can access both instance-specific and class-wide (static) data.

4. **Static Method (`displayTotalCupsSold()`)**:
   - `displayTotalCupsSold()` is a static method, so it can only directly access the static member `totalCupSold` and cannot access instance-specific members like `cupsSoldBySeller`.

### Key Points:
- **Non-static methods** can access both static and non-static members of the class.
  - **Static members** belong to the class, so they can be accessed by any method, whether static or non-static.
  - **Non-static members** belong to specific instances, so only non-static methods can directly access them.
  
- **Static methods** can only access static members because they are not tied to any instance. Static methods do not have access to instance-specific data (non-static members) because they do not have an associated object.

### Output Example:

```
Enter the number of cups sold by seller 1: 10
Cups served by this seller: 10
Cups sold by this seller: 10
Enter the number of cups sold by seller 2: 20
Cups served by this seller: 20
Cups sold by this seller: 20
Total cups sold by all tea sellers: 30
Cups sold by this seller: 10
Total cups sold by all sellers: 30
Cups sold by this seller: 20
Total cups sold by all sellers: 30
```

### Conclusion:
- Non-static methods can easily access **both static and non-static member variables**. This is because non-static methods belong to an object and can interact with both the instance-specific data and class-wide (static) data.
- Static methods, on the other hand, can only interact with **static members**, because they do not have an instance of the class to work with.
