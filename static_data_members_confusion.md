The line `int TeaStall::totalCupsSold = 0;` is used to **initialize the static data member** `totalCupsSold` outside the class. It is important to understand why we need to initialize static members separately and why this is done outside of a constructor.

### Reasons:

1. **Static Members Belong to the Class, Not Objects**:
   Static data members are **shared** across all instances of the class. They do not belong to any specific object but to the class itself. Because of this, they need to be initialized only once for the entire class, and this initialization must be done outside of any constructor. A constructor is typically used to initialize **instance-specific** data members (i.e., non-static members) that belong to a particular object.

   For example, if you had:
   ```cpp
   class TeaStall {
   private:
       static int totalCupsSold;  // Static data member
   public:
       TeaStall() {
           totalCupsSold = 0;  // This would be incorrect for a static member
       }
   };
   ```
   This would not work properly because the constructor is called each time an object is created, which would set the static member `totalCupsSold` to `0` again, leading to incorrect results. The static variable should only be initialized once for the entire class, not per object.

2. **Static Data Members Are Not Associated with an Object**:
   Static data members exist independently of any specific object of the class. They are part of the class itself, so they can only be initialized once, not per object. This initialization is done outside the class to ensure that there is only one copy of the static member, no matter how many objects are instantiated.

   ```cpp
   int TeaStall::totalCupsSold = 0;  // This ensures that the static member is initialized only once.
   ```

   - **Inside the class**: If you attempt to initialize a static data member inside the class definition, it would be considered a declaration but not an actual definition (except in the case of `const` and `inline` static members).
   - **Outside the class**: The actual **definition** and initialization of the static member are done outside the class.

3. **Why Not Use a Constructor for Static Members?**:
   A constructor is meant for initializing **instance-specific** data members, not static ones. Static members are shared across all instances, so initializing them in the constructor would cause redundant initializations and possibly incorrect behavior. For example, each time a new object is created, the static data member would be reinitialized, which is not the intended behavior.

4. **Better Control and Initialization**:
   By initializing the static member outside the class, you get better control over the initialization process. It ensures that the static member is only initialized once, and it is also a clear way to manage static members.

### Example Breakdown:

```cpp
class TeaStall {
private:
    static int totalCupsSold;  // Static data member
public:
    TeaStall() {
        // No need to initialize totalCupsSold here because it's static
    }

    void serveTea(int cups) {
        totalCupsSold += cups;  // This will modify the static member
    }

    static void displayTotalCupsSold() {
        cout << "Total cups sold by all tea sellers: " << totalCupsSold << endl;
    }
};

// Initialize the static data member outside the class
int TeaStall::totalCupsSold = 0;  // Initializes the static member to 0 only once

int main() {
    TeaStall seller1, seller2;

    seller1.serveTea(10);
    seller2.serveTea(20);

    TeaStall::displayTotalCupsSold();  // Displays the total cups sold

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Static members are initialized outside the class** to ensure that they are initialized only once, regardless of the number of objects.
- **Static data members are shared across all objects** of the class, so they don't need to be initialized per object in the constructor.
- **Constructors are used for instance-specific data members**, not static ones. Static members are intended to represent class-wide data that should not change between individual objects.

By following this practice, you ensure that the static member behaves as intended: shared across all instances and only initialized once.
