The explanation revolves around **static data members** and **how they are initialized** in C++. Let's break this down step-by-step for clarity:

### 1. **Static Data Members in C++**:
- A **static data member** is a variable that is shared by **all instances** (objects) of a class. It is not tied to any particular object but to the **class itself**.
- Static data members are **initialized outside the class**, usually in the source file (outside the class definition) because the compiler needs to know how much memory to allocate for it, and a static member belongs to the class, not to an instance.

### 2. **Default Initialization of Static Members**:
- Static data members are **not initialized** inside the class itself (i.e., you cannot assign a value to them directly in the class body).
- If you don’t initialize a static variable explicitly, the default value depends on its type:
  - For **primitive types** (like `int`, `double`), if not initialized explicitly, static variables **are automatically initialized to zero** by the compiler.
  - For **non-primitive types** (like classes or objects), you need to define a constructor or provide an initializer.

### 3. **Initializing Static Variables Outside the Class**:
- Static variables must be **initialized outside** the class, typically in the implementation file (source code), because they are class-level variables, and the compiler needs to know that there is only **one instance** of the variable shared among all objects.
- **Why outside the class?**: 
  - Inside the class, we only declare that the variable exists; we do not define its actual memory location or provide an initial value.
  - Outside the class, we **define** the static variable and provide the **initial value**.

### 4. **Why Can You Set a Random Value for the Static Variable?**
- When you define the static variable outside the class (in this case, `TeaStall::totalCupSold`), **you can set it to any value** you like.
  - C++ allows you to define a static data member to have any value that makes sense for your application. The value you set is **global** across all instances of the class. It is **shared** and **consistent** for all objects of the class.
  - **This is why setting `int TeaStall::totalCupSold = 2500;` is allowed** — you are simply initializing it to a custom value, and it will be the same for all objects of `TeaStall`.

### 5. **Code Explanation**:
```cpp
private:
    // Static data member to track the total number of cups sold by all tea sellers
    static int totalCupSold; // Default value is 0, but initialization not allowed here

// Initialize the static data member outside the class
// This is important because static members must be defined outside the class
// static variable is also called `Class Variable` in OOP
// For clarification --> https://shorturl.at/8QbxF

// You can initialize with any value you want, here we are setting 2500.
int TeaStall::totalCupSold = 2500;  // Here we can set any value as we want (allowed)
```

- **Static Data Member (`totalCupSold`)**:
  - This variable tracks the total cups sold by **all instances** (objects) of `TeaStall`. It is shared among all `TeaStall` objects.
  - The **default value** is zero if no value is explicitly assigned, but it's **not allowed to assign a value inside the class definition**.

- **Static Data Member Initialization (`int TeaStall::totalCupSold = 2500;`)**:
  - Here, you are defining the static variable `totalCupSold` **outside the class** and setting it to a custom value (in this case, `2500`).
  - You **can set this to any value** you choose because this is where the static variable is actually created in memory. This value will be the same for every object of `TeaStall`.

### 6. **Why Can You Set a Random Value?**
- The value assigned here is not random in the sense that it is arbitrary and can be any number you want.
- Setting this value provides a **default state** for the static variable. All objects will share this same initial value unless it is modified by an instance or method (as shown in the `serveTea` method, where you can change `totalCupSold`).
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  int TeaStall::totalCupSold = 2500;  // This is an arbitrary starting value.
  ```

  - This means when the program starts, the total number of cups sold by all tea sellers is **2500**. As new cups are sold, this value can increase based on the logic in the `serveTea()` method.

### 7. **Why We Don't Initialize Static Variables Inside the Class**:
- In C++, you **cannot initialize a static member inside the class** because the class is just a blueprint, not an actual object. Static members are part of the class definition but need to be **defined in memory** outside the class (in your source code).
- If you did try to initialize the static variable inside the class, it would result in a **compilation error**.

### Example of What Not to Do:
```cpp
class TeaStall {
private:
    static int totalCupSold = 0;  // Error: Cannot initialize a static member inside the class
};
```

### Conclusion:
- **Static members** belong to the **class** and not to individual objects, and they can be accessed and modified by all instances of the class.
- **Static members** must be **initialized outside** the class definition, and you can assign any value to them during initialization. This initialization can be done at the time of definition.
