The ampersand (`&`) in the function parameter list indicates **pass-by-reference**. Here's why it's used in the `transferFunds` function:

### Why Use `&` (Pass-by-Reference)?

1. **Avoid Copying Large Objects**:  
   When you pass objects by value (without `&`), the entire object is copied. For large objects, this can consume significant memory and processing time. By passing by reference, we avoid creating a copy and instead work directly with the original object.

2. **Modify the Original Object**:  
   The purpose of the `transferFunds` function is to update the `balance` of both the sender and receiver. By passing the objects by reference, we ensure that any changes made within the function directly affect the original objects.

3. **Efficiency**:  
   Passing by reference is more efficient for complex data structures like objects. It reduces overhead because no additional memory allocation or copy operation is required.

### Code Example

```cpp
// Without &
void transferFunds(BankAccount sender, BankAccount receiver, double amount) {
    sender.balance -= amount; // Modifies a copy, not the original
    receiver.balance += amount; // Modifies a copy, not the original
    // Changes are lost after the function ends
}

// With &
void transferFunds(BankAccount &sender, BankAccount &receiver, double amount) {
    sender.balance -= amount; // Modifies the original sender
    receiver.balance += amount; // Modifies the original receiver
    // Changes persist after the function ends
}
```

### Summary

Using `&` in this case ensures:
- The original `BankAccount` objects are modified.
- Memory and performance efficiency are maintained.
